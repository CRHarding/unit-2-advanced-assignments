# Unit 2: Advanced Assignments
A collection of advanced assignments for learners to complete during build week

## About
Alright folks, let's get this party started! First things first, these are *not* required. These are meant as assignments for students who passed all of their sprints and are looking for suggestions for what to tackle first. These are *much* more open ended than previous lessons and are *much* more difficult. These are meant to challenge you.

## Thought Process
The reasoning behind these projects was to choose tasks that would get you to think more like a programmer. So far we've been building websites, which is fantastic, so know we're hoping to exercise the other side of the brain with more 'puzzle' type exercises. To be clear: you're going to need both skills to succeed as a developer.

## Stop talking already and tell us what to do already!
Ok, so I went ahead and took three projects I'd made much, much, *much* earlier in my career as a developer. I chose these projects as a way to challenge myself and because of the skills they taught. DRY principals (Don't Repeat Yourself), OOP best practices, modern JavaScript, recursion, and just good programming practices in general. They started messy, and are now slightly less messy after working on them for a few months. Here is the site where they are hosted: https://caseys-palace.herokuapp.com/

The idea is you have to play minesweeper to make money, and then spend that money playing either blackjack or poker. I recommend starting with BlackJack, using what you learned from BlackJack move on to Poker, and then, finally, try and tackle Minesweeper (by far the hardest one).

FYI I never finished minesweeper so you can't flag the bombs so there is no 'winning', but you do get CaseyBucks which, in my humble opinion, are worth more than a 'victory' any day (even if the computer makes fun of you for quitting).

There are no other directions, there are no rules (well, besides the rules inherent to the games themselves), this is meant for you to go down rabbit holes, make mistakes, duckduckgo like your life depends on it, dream about the code, solve problem after problem. To put it simply: to immerse yourself in the code for a week, and hopefully start something that you can continue and update as time goes on.

So, go forth and prosper!! 

## FINAL NOTE
Please, please, please make something that looks better than what I came up with...apparently back then I didn't know CSS existed :(...

## FINAL, FINAL, REALLY FINAL NOTE (jeeze does this guy ever stop talking?!)
If you're not interested in any of the above, here are some extra options to get those creative juices flowing (in no particular order):

1. Hangman
2. Tower of Hanoi
3. A Microsoft Paint Clone
4. Reddit
5. Tic Tac Toe
6. Memory (where you flip a card over and try and match it with it's pair)
7. Connect Four

You can also feel free to pick anything else (although we recommend those as they're challenging without being impossible and also stretch those sweet, sweet programming muscles!
